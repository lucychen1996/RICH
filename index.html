            <h3>ORGANIZATION INFORMATION</h3>
            <p>
                Richard's Imagine Center of Hope, Inc. (HOPE) will provide temporary housing, educational/ vocational support, and counseling to individuals who are seeking permanent housing, educational resources, employment options, mental/physical guidance, and financial freedom towards a brighter future.  The organization will serve as a citywide network and referral service for education systems, social service agencies, and community organizations; operate an information and education center for college readiness and workforce development practices, and promote social justice awareness for the citizens of the City of Pittsburgh.  It will serve as a referral and support system to address people's academic, financial, social, emotional, and mental needs.  The center will address homelessness, high school dropouts, housing, youth development, career development, teen parenting, community pride, and civic engagement.  The target group is individuals needing a second or third chance to live a normal life with normal circumstances, interested in career development, willing to improve the quality of life for themselves and those whom they care for, and eager to learn and grow with adequate support systems in place.  If I had to put an age range for my target group it would be 13-25.  The center is willing to work with individuals who are serious about the outcomes of their futures.  Not just talking the talk but walking the walk.
